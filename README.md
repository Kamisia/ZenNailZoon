## Project Description

ZenNailZoon is a sample website for a nail styling salon. The site includes descriptions of services and information about the staff, along with their sample portfolios. Users can find the salon's contact information and fill out a contact form. The website also features links to social media and offers the option to subscribe to a newsletter. All forms are validated using the React Hook Form library.

## Project Development Plans

**Functionality**: In the future, I plan to add the ability to book and/or cancel services in the calendar of a selected nail stylist, send newsletters with information about promotions or special services, and send reminders about upcoming appointments.

**Increasing content**: Adding a blog section where articles on nail styling and care will be published, along with tips on how to prepare for an appointment, etc.
